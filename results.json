Each picture book in this series is a biography of a significant historical figure, told in a simple, conversational, vivacious way, and always focusing on a character trait that made the person heroic. The heros are depicted as children throughout, telling their life stories in first-person present tense, which keeps the books playful and accessible to young children. And each book ends with a line of encouragement, a direct quote, and photos on the last page. This story focuses on Rosa Parks and how she always stood up for what's right. This friendly, fun biography series inspired the PBS Kids TV show Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum. One great role model at a time, these books encourage kids to dream big. Included in each book are: • A timeline of key events in the hero’s history • Photos that bring the story more fully to life • Comic-book-style illustrations that are irresistibly adorable • Childhood moments that influenced the hero • Facts that make great conversation-starters • A virtue this person embodies: Rosa Parks's strength is highlighted in this biography. You’ll want to collect each book in this dynamic, informative series!",

When a terrible drought struck William Kamkwamba's tiny village in Malawi, his family lost all of the season's crops, leaving them with nothing to eat and nothing to sell. William began to explore science books in his village library, looking for a solution. There, he came up with the idea that would change his family's life forever: he could build a windmill. Made out of scrap metal and old bicycle parts, William's windmill brought electricity to his home and helped his family pump the water they needed to farm the land. Retold for a younger audience, this exciting memoir shows how, even in a desperate situation, one boy's brilliant idea can light up the world. Complete with photographs, illustrations, and an epilogue that will bring readers up to date on William's story, this is the perfect edition to read and share with the whole family.",

She’s sure the kids are staring at the Phonic Ear, the powerful aid that will help her hear her teacher. Too bad it also seems certain to repel potential friends. Then Cece makes a startling discovery. With the Phonic Ear she can hear her teacher not just in the classroom but anywhere her teacher is in the school—in the hallway . . . in the teacher’s lounge . . . in the bathroom! This is power. Maybe even superpower! Cece is on her way to becoming El Deafo, Listener for All. But the funny thing about being a superhero is that it’s just another way of feeling different . . . and lonely. Can Cece channel her powers into finding the thing she wants most, a true friend? El Deafo is a book that will entertain children, give hearing-impaired children a hero of their own, and challenge others to consider an experience unlike their own. Like other great works for children, it provides the opportunity for young readers to consider how they would act or react in a similar situation, helping to build empathy and understanding through the power of story.",

In this story based on the author-illustrator's own childhood, Patricia Polacco once again celebrates the power teachers have to help us discover the potential we each hold. Young Trisha is devastated when she finds out that her class at her new school is known as the junkyard. It is a special class, and she had moved from where she used to live so she wouldn’t be in a special class anymore! But then she meets her teacher, the amazing Mrs. Peterson, and her classmates, an oddly brilliant group of misfit kids, whom the other kids in school call the junkyard kids. Much to her own surprise, it is here in the junkyard that Trisha discovers the true meaning of genius, and that this group of misfits are, in fact, Junkyard Wonders, each and every one of them. Now with questions at the back of the book to help guide readers through discussions about the ideas featured in the story, this kindness edition of The Junkyard Wonders brings celebrated author-illustrator Patricia Polacco's work to a new audience of young readers who can be inspired by its message.",

          "description": "The extraordinary true story of a young girl's courage in the face of violence and extremism, and an incredible testament to what can be achieved when we stand up for what we believe in. This illustrated adaptation of Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai's bestselling memoir, I Am Malala, introduces readers of 7+ to the remarkable story of a teenage girl who risked her life for the right to go to school. Raised in a changing Pakistan by an enlightened father from a poor background and a beautiful, illiterate mother, Malala was taught to stand up for her beliefs. When terrorists took control of her region and declared that girls were forbidden from going to school, Malala refused to sacrifice her education. And on 9 October 2012, she nearly paid the ultimate price for her courage when she was shot on her way home from school. The book follows Malala's incredible journey to recovery in the aftermath of the attack, from the life-saving surgery she receives in a Birmingham hospital to her reunion with her family and their eventual relocation to England. Today Malala is a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest ever person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Her story of bravery and determination in the face of extremism is more timely now than ever. * This is an abridged, illustrated chapter book edition of I AM MALALA (Malala's bestselling young adult memoir), made suitable for readers aged 7 and up. This edition features black and white line art and age-appropriate extra content after the main text. *",
